# What is the program about

The hello.js file contains 3 different approaches of printing out paramater **name** 5 times:

1. Using a predefind parameter {name} and printing out the greeting 5 times
2. Passing a command line argument and printing that value as Hello {argument} by typing:

```
node hello.js John
```

which will print out "Hello John", or if a command you are using:

```
node hello.js
```

then it will print out set name 5 times
